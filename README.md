# Horiseon-Media-Project
This website explains different aspects of media and shows how to use these asoects in different ways.
this includes; search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.

This project uses html and css to make a website that is fit for desktop.

This page goes over different types of media and displays different ways to capitalize off of them.

This website is split into roughly three parts: the header, the content, and the benefits.

The header shows the website/company name. And what type of media that will be talked about through the page. The 'content' section shows the content that is stated in the header. These describe the three of the media topics shown in the header. The 'benefits' section is there to wrap up the page and describe some more strategies to utilize.
