# Horiseon-Media-Project

This project uses html and css to make a website that is fit for desktop.

This website goes over different types of media and displays different ways to capitalize off of them.


This website is split into roughly three parts: the header, the content, and the benefits.

The header shows the website/company name. And what type of media that will be talked about through the page.
The 'content' section shows the content that is stated in the header. These describe the three of the media topics shown in the header.
The 'benefits' section is there to wrap up the page and describe some more strategies to utilize.
